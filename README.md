Hi :-)
I'm proudly present my very first module for vcv now...
I wanted to make something unique, and got an idea:
Making sound out of an image! Kind of painting some music.
Sounds a bit crazy at first (i know). But it's easy to understand.
It's just a matter of converting the color of a pixel (RGB values)
readed from an image(png) into control voltages for vcv.

Technically my module named Pictogram is an image sampler that
collect pixel data and yields cv values. I'm not the first one
with such an idea.
Look at Bidoo::Emil and Bidoo::Limonade. These modules are image
controlled oscillators. (ICO's) :-D
Thank you Bidoo for making it open source!
First i was not sure is Pictogram a sequencer or a sampler. I
come to the conclusion: It is an utility that plays a sequence
and can sample at the same time.
To be continued...
